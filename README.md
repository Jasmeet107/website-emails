# Find All Email Addresses on a Website

Given some website, this program will find all email addresses on any of the pages with that domain name. However, it does not consider web pages on subdomains. 

Setup: 
 * I've included a `requirements.txt` file. 
 * The libraries I use can also be directly installed using the command line: `pip install lxml` and `pip install requests` 
 * To run, enter `python find_email_addresses.py [website]` into the command line from the project directory, where the website argument is a valid website URL.
